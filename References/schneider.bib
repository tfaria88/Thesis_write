	abstract = {Molecular-dynamics results simulating a canonical ensemble with nearly conserved energy are presented and discussed for a one-component model exhibiting a distortive continuous-phase transition. Our results demonstrate (i) that the static properties are consistent with the universality hypothesis; (ii) the formation of clusters; (iii) second sound in a temperature window below Tc; (iv) central peaks due to the cluster dynamics and heat diffusion; (v) that the critical slowing-down data are consistent with the universality hypothesis for dynamic critical phenomena; and (vi) envelope solitonlike heat-pulse propagation in the second-sound regime.},
