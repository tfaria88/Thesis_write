\chapter{LAMMPS Code Modifications}
\label{chap:chapter_3}

\section{Section}
\label{sec:section_1}

LAMMPS is a molecular dynamics code that models particles in a liquid, solid or gaseous state\cite{lammps_manual}. It can model atomic and polymeric systems using a variety of force fields and
boundary conditions. Even that code is primarily aimed for molecular dynamics simulations of atomistic systems, it provides a fully parallelized framework for particle simulations
governed by Newton's equations of motion. Due to its particle nature, SPH is totally compatible with the existing code architecture and data structures present in LAMMPS. There is 
an add-on module in LAMMPS that includes the SPH module into the code.\par
