The gas is assumed to be inviscid, and the equation of state polytropic, but otherwise no restrictive assumptions are made. In particular, we allow the gas to move arbitrarily in three dimensions.
The configurations we examine are similar to the classical Roche and Darwin problems. They are binaries initially in synchronous, circular orbits which become dynamically unstable when the orbital radius is sufficiently small.
The results show that the classical formulae for the onset of disruption, where they can be tested, are also reasonably accurate for compressible stars. The final states of the unstable systems reveal a variety of one- and two-armed spirals, and complex ring structures. They are similar to some of those found by A. and J. Toomre, and corroborate their view that rotating systems, under the influence of strong non-axisymmetric perturbations, produce thin tails and spiral structure very easily.},

	abstract = {We carry out fluid-structure interaction simulations of self-propelled virtual swimmers to investigate the effects of body shape (form) and kinematics on the hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming. To separate the effects of form and kinematics, we employ four different virtual swimmers: a carangiform swimmer (i.e. a mackerel swimming like mackerel do in nature); an anguilliform swimmer (i.e. a lamprey swimming like lampreys do in nature); a hybrid swimmer with anguilliform kinematics but carangiform body shape (a mackerel swimming like a lamprey); and another hybrid swimmer with carangiform kinematics but anguilliform body shape (a lamprey swimming like a mackerel). By comparing the performance of swimmers with different kinematics but similar body shapes we study the effects of kinematics whereas by comparing swimmers with similar kinematics but different body shapes we study the effects of form. We show that the anguilliform kinematics not only reaches higher velocities but is also more efficient in the viscous (Re approximately 10(2)) and transitional (Re approximately 10(3)) regimes. However, in the inertial regime (Re=infinity) carangiform kinematics achieves higher velocities and is also more efficient than the anguilliform kinematics. The mackerel body achieves higher swimming speeds in all cases but is more efficient in the inertial regime only whereas the lamprey body is more efficient in the transitional regime. We also show that form and kinematics have little overall effect on the 3-D structure of the wake (i.e. single vs double row vortex streets), which mainly depends on the Strouhal number. Nevertheless, body shape is found to somewhat affect the small-scale features and complexity of the vortex rings shed by the various swimmers.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of anguilliform swimming motions was investigated using three-dimensional simulations of the fluid flow past a self-propelled body. The motion of the body is not specified a priori, but is instead obtained through an evolutionary algorithm used to optimize the swimming efficiency and the burst swimming speed. The results of the present simulations support the hypothesis that anguilliform swimmers modify their kinematics according to different objectives and provide a quantitative analysis of the swimming motion and the forces experienced by the body. The kinematics of burst swimming is characterized by the large amplitude of the tail undulations while the anterior part of the body remains straight. In contrast, during efficient swimming behavior significant lateral undulation occurs along the entire length of the body. In turn, during burst swimming, the majority of the thrust is generated at the tail, whereas in the efficient swimming mode, in addition to the tail, the middle of the body contributes significantly to the thrust. The burst swimming velocity is 42\% higher and the propulsive efficiency is 15\% lower than the respective values during efficient swimming. The wake, for both swimming modes, consists largely of a double row of vortex rings with an axis aligned with the swimming direction. The vortex rings are responsible for producing lateral jets of fluid, which has been documented in prior experimental studies. We note that the primary wake vortices are qualitatively similar in both swimming modes except that the wake vortex rings are stronger and relatively more elongated in the fast swimming mode. The present results provide quantitative information of three-dimensional fluid-body interactions that may complement related experimental studies. In addition they enable a detailed quantitative analysis, which may be difficult to obtain experimentally, of the different swimming modes linking the kinematics of the motion with the forces acting on the self-propelled body. Finally, the optimization procedure helps to identify, in a systematic fashion, links between swimming motion and biological function.},

Cervical mucus filters out sperm with poor morphology and motility and as such only a minority of ejaculated sperm actually enter the cervix. In the uterus, muscular contractions may enhance passage of sperm through the uterine cavity. A few thousand sperm swim through the uterotubal junctions to reach the Fallopian tubes (uterine tubes, oviducts) where sperm are stored in a reservoir, or at least maintained in a fertile state, by interacting with endosalpingeal (oviductal) epithelium. As the time of ovulation approaches, sperm become capacitated and hyperactivated, which enables them to proceed towards the tubal ampulla. Sperm may be guided to the oocyte by a combination of thermotaxis and chemotaxis. Motility hyperactivation assists sperm in penetrating mucus in the tubes and the cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida of the oocyte, so that they may finally fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane. Knowledge of the biology of sperm transport can inspire improvements in artificial insemination, {IVF}, the diagnosis of infertility and the development of contraceptives.},

	abstract = {Sperm are propelled by an actively beating tail, and display a wide variety of swimming patterns. When confined between two parallel walls, sperm swim either in circles or on curvilinear trajectories close to the walls. We employ mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations in combination with a mechanical sperm model to study the swimming behavior near walls. The simulations show that sperm become captured at the wall due to the hydrodynamic flow fields which are generated by the flagellar beat. The circular trajectories are determined by the chiral asymmetry of the sperm shape. For strong (weak) chirality, sperm swim in tight (wide) circles, with the beating plane of the flagellum oriented perpendicular (parallel) to the wall. For comparison, we also perform simulations based on a local anisotropic friction of the flagellum. In this resistive force approximation, surface adhesion and circular swimming patterns are obtained as well. However, the adhesion mechanism is now due to steric repulsion, and the orientation of the beating plane is different. Our model provides a theoretical framework that explains several distinct swimming behaviors of sperm near and far from a wall. Moreover, the model suggests a mechanism by which sperm navigate in a chemical gradient via a change of their shape.},

	abstract = {The swimming of long animals like snakes, eels and marine worms is idealized by considering the equilibrium of a flexible cylinder immersed in water when waves of bending of constant amplitude travel down it at constant speed. The force of each element of the cylinder is assumed to be the same as that which would act on a corresponding element of a long straight cylinder moving at the same speed and inclination to the direction of motion. Relevant aerodynamic data for smooth cylinders are first generalized to make them applicable over a wide range of speed and cylinder diameter. The formulae so obtained are applied to the idealized animal and a connexion established between B/\${\textbackslash}lambda \$, V / U and R\$\_\{1\}\$. Here B and \${\textbackslash}lambda \$ are the amplitude and wave-length, V the velocity attained when the wave is propagated with velocity U, R\$\_\{1\}\$ is the Reynolds number Ud\${\textbackslash}rho \$/\${\textbackslash}mu \$, where d is the diameter of the cylinder, \${\textbackslash}rho \$ and \${\textbackslash}mu \$ are the density and viscosity of water. The results of calculation are compared with James Gray's photographs of a swimming snake and a leech. The amplitude of the waves which produce the greatest forward speed for a given output of energy is calculated and found, in the case of the snake, to be very close to that revealed by photographs. Similar calculations using force formulae applicable to rough cylinders yield results which differ from those for smooth ones in that when the roughness is sufficiently great and has a certain directional character propulsion can be achieved by a wave of bending which is propagated forward instead of backward. Gray's photographs of a marine worm show that this remarkable method of propulsion does in fact occur in the animal world.},

Following unstimulated cycles, the left- and right-sides of the musculature were alternately stimulated at supra-maximal voltages and at eight different phases relative to the strain cycle of the muscle. The body's flexural stiffness (Nm2) increased maximally by a factor of three relative to that when the muscles were unstimulated. The net external work (J kg−1) needed to bend the body decreased maximally by a factor of seven relative to that when the muscles were unstimulated. Both of these mechanical features varied sinusoidally with changes in the phase of the stimulus. Stimulus phase of caudal muscle in live swimming eels, taken from other studies, leads to the prediction that the caudal muscles increase body stiffness and produce net positive mechanical work simultaneously during steady forward swimming. The association of increased body stiffness and net positive muscle work, and the occurrence of maximal net muscle power output at a stimulus phase of 325° (as the muscle segment lengthens), suggests that net positive power is produced, in part, using an elastic strain energy mechanism.},

	abstract = {Electromyography and cinematography were used to determine the activity of epaxial muscles of colubrid snakes during terrestrial and aquatic lateral undulatory locomotion. In both types of lateral undulation, at a given longitudinal position, segments of three muscles (Mm. semispinalis-spinalis, longissimus dorsi, and iliocostalis) usually show synchronous activity. Muscle activity propagates posteriorly and generally is unilateral. With each muscle, large numbers of adjacent segments (30 to 100) show simultaneous activity. Terrestrial and aquatic undulation differ in two major respects. (1) During terrestrial undulation, muscle activity in a particular region begins when that portion of the body has reached maximal convex flexion and ends when it is maximally concave; this phase relation is uniform along the entire snake. During swimming, however, muscle activity passes posteriorly faster than the wave of vertebral flexion, causing the relation of muscle activity to flexion to change along the length of the snake. (2) In the terrestrial mode, the block of active muscle segments remains approximately constant in size as it passes down the snake, whereas during swimming the number of adjacent active muscle segments increases posteriorly. Despite the fact that Elaphe obsoleta has nearly twice as many body vertebrate as Nerodia fasciata (240 vs. 125), the only difference observed in the swimming of these two species is that a larger number of adjacent muscle segments is simultaneously active in comparable regions of Elaphe obsoleta than in Nerodia fasciata.},

	abstract = {Two areas that have received substantial attention in investigations of muscle activity during fish swimming are (1) patterns of fiber type recruitment with swimming speed and (2) the timing of muscle activation in relation to muscle strain. Currently, very little is known about either of these areas in eels, which represent an extreme body form among fishes and utilize a mode of locomotion found at one end of the undulatory spectrum (anguilliform locomotion). To assess how this swimming mode and body form influence the neuromuscular control of swimming, I recorded electromyographic data from red and white muscle at four positions, 0.3L, 0.45L, 0.6L and 0.75L, where L is body length, in eels (Anguilla rostrata) simultaneously video-taped (250 fields s-1) swimming at three speeds, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 L s-1. As in other fish, exclusively red muscle is used at slow swimming speeds and white muscle is additionally recruited at higher swimming speeds. However, this study also revealed a novel posterior-to-anterior pattern of muscle recruitment with increasing swimming speed. At slow speeds, anteriorly located muscles are never active, muscle strain is negligible and forward thrust must be generated by posterior muscles. As speed increases, more anterior muscles are additionally recruited. Electromyogram ({EMG}) burst durations typically occupy between 0.2 and 0.3 undulatory cycles, irrespective of speed or position. {EMG} burst intensity increases significantly with swimming speed. The onset of {EMG} activity typically occurred near the end of muscle lengthening, whereas the offset of {EMG} activity occurred during shortening (typically before the muscle's return to resting length). There was a significant shift in red muscle onset times such that anterior muscles were typically active later in their strain cycle than posterior muscles. When red muscle activity patterns across various fish taxa are compared, differences in propulsive wavelength among species are related to differences in muscle activity, providing insight into the underlying neuromuscular bases of differences among undulatory swimming modes.},

As a remedy, a new algorithm is proposed that combines the homogenization of the particle configuration by a background pressure while at the same time reduces artificial numerical dissipation. The transport or advection velocity of particles is modified and an effective stress term occurs in the momentum balance that accounts for the difference between advection velocity times particle density and actual particle momentum. The present formulation can be applied for internal flows where the density summation is applicable. A wide range of test cases demonstrates unprecedented accuracy and stability of the proposed modification even at previously infeasible conditions.},

In this paper we introduce the idea of time-varying coefficients which fits more naturally with a particle formulation. Each particle has a viscosity parameter which evolves according to a simple source and decay equation. The source causes the parameter to grow when the particle enters a shock and the decay term causes it to decay to a small value beyond the shock. Tests on one-dimensional shocks and a two-dimensional shock–bubble interaction confirm that the method gives good results.},
