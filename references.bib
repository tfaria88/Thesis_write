The gas is assumed to be inviscid, and the equation of state polytropic, but otherwise no restrictive assumptions are made. In particular, we allow the gas to move arbitrarily in three dimensions.
The configurations we examine are similar to the classical Roche and Darwin problems. They are binaries initially in synchronous, circular orbits which become dynamically unstable when the orbital radius is sufficiently small.
The results show that the classical formulae for the onset of disruption, where they can be tested, are also reasonably accurate for compressible stars. The final states of the unstable systems reveal a variety of one- and two-armed spirals, and complex ring structures. They are similar to some of those found by A. and J. Toomre, and corroborate their view that rotating systems, under the influence of strong non-axisymmetric perturbations, produce thin tails and spiral structure very easily.},

The model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations, which are solved numerically. The model's first part is a simplified description of the kinetics of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and binding to muscle protein filaments, in response to neural activation. The second part is based on A. V. Hill's mechanical model of muscle, consisting of elastic and contractile elements in series, the latter obeying known physiological properties.

The model is then used to predict the forces developed under conditions of applied sinusoidal length changes, and the results compared with corresponding data. The most significant advance of this model is the incorporation of work-dependent deactivation, whereby a muscle that has been shortening under load generates less force after the shortening ceases than otherwise expected.

	abstract = {We carry out fluid-structure interaction simulations of self-propelled virtual swimmers to investigate the effects of body shape (form) and kinematics on the hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming. To separate the effects of form and kinematics, we employ four different virtual swimmers: a carangiform swimmer (i.e. a mackerel swimming like mackerel do in nature); an anguilliform swimmer (i.e. a lamprey swimming like lampreys do in nature); a hybrid swimmer with anguilliform kinematics but carangiform body shape (a mackerel swimming like a lamprey); and another hybrid swimmer with carangiform kinematics but anguilliform body shape (a lamprey swimming like a mackerel). By comparing the performance of swimmers with different kinematics but similar body shapes we study the effects of kinematics whereas by comparing swimmers with similar kinematics but different body shapes we study the effects of form. We show that the anguilliform kinematics not only reaches higher velocities but is also more efficient in the viscous (Re approximately 10(2)) and transitional (Re approximately 10(3)) regimes. However, in the inertial regime (Re=infinity) carangiform kinematics achieves higher velocities and is also more efficient than the anguilliform kinematics. The mackerel body achieves higher swimming speeds in all cases but is more efficient in the inertial regime only whereas the lamprey body is more efficient in the transitional regime. We also show that form and kinematics have little overall effect on the 3-D structure of the wake (i.e. single vs double row vortex streets), which mainly depends on the Strouhal number. Nevertheless, body shape is found to somewhat affect the small-scale features and complexity of the vortex rings shed by the various swimmers.},

	doi = {10.1242/jeb.02526},
	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of anguilliform swimming motions was investigated using three-dimensional simulations of the fluid flow past a self-propelled body. The motion of the body is not specified a priori, but is instead obtained through an evolutionary algorithm used to optimize the swimming efficiency and the burst swimming speed. The results of the present simulations support the hypothesis that anguilliform swimmers modify their kinematics according to different objectives and provide a quantitative analysis of the swimming motion and the forces experienced by the body. The kinematics of burst swimming is characterized by the large amplitude of the tail undulations while the anterior part of the body remains straight. In contrast, during efficient swimming behavior significant lateral undulation occurs along the entire length of the body. In turn, during burst swimming, the majority of the thrust is generated at the tail, whereas in the efficient swimming mode, in addition to the tail, the middle of the body contributes significantly to the thrust. The burst swimming velocity is 42\% higher and the propulsive efficiency is 15\% lower than the respective values during efficient swimming. The wake, for both swimming modes, consists largely of a double row of vortex rings with an axis aligned with the swimming direction. The vortex rings are responsible for producing lateral jets of fluid, which has been documented in prior experimental studies. We note that the primary wake vortices are qualitatively similar in both swimming modes except that the wake vortex rings are stronger and relatively more elongated in the fast swimming mode. The present results provide quantitative information of three-dimensional fluid-body interactions that may complement related experimental studies. In addition they enable a detailed quantitative analysis, which may be difficult to obtain experimentally, of the different swimming modes linking the kinematics of the motion with the forces acting on the self-propelled body. Finally, the optimization procedure helps to identify, in a systematic fashion, links between swimming motion and biological function.},
